## **README: LFI/RFI Dork Generator Bash Script**

### **Description**

The **LFI/RFI Dork Generator Bash Script** is a tool that generates Google Dork search URLs specifically for identifying **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities** (Local File Inclusion - LFI, and Remote File Inclusion - RFI) in web applications. These vulnerabilities are often found in PHP applications where improper input validation allows an attacker to include local or remote files, potentially leading to serious security breaches such as code execution, data theft, and website defacement.

This script provides a simple way to generate Google Dork links that can be used for security testing and vulnerability discovery.

---

### **Features**

- **Predefined Dorks**: The script comes with predefined Google Dorks for both **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** and **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input a domain (e.g., `example.com`) and generates Google Dork links specific to that domain.
- **Output**: All generated search links are displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file for easy reference.
- **Google Dork Encoding**: The script automatically encodes the dork queries for safe usage in Google search URLs.

---

### **Usage**

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Save the script as `lfi_rfi_dork_generator.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x lfi_rfi_dork_generator.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./lfi_rfi_dork_generator.sh
   ```

4. **Enter Domain**: When prompted, enter the domain you want to test (e.g., `example.com`).

5. **Results**: The script will generate a list of Google Dork search URLs for the given domain. These links will be displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file (`lfi_rfi_dork_links_<domain>.txt`).

---

### **Example Output**

If you enter the domain `example.com`, the output will look like this:

```
https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexample.com+inurl%3A%22%3Fpage%3D%22
https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexample.com+inurl%3A%22%3Ffile%3D%22
https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexample.com+inurl%3A%22%3Ffile%3Dphp%3A%2F%2Finput%22
https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexample.com+inurl%3A%22%3Fpage%3D%2F%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%22
...
```

These are Google search links that you can use to identify potential file inclusion vulnerabilities on the specified domain.

### **What is File Inclusion Vulnerability?**

**File Inclusion Vulnerabilities** refer to weaknesses in a web application's code where an attacker can manipulate the application to include files that should not be accessible. These vulnerabilities often exist due to improper input sanitization and validation.

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: Occurs when an attacker can include files that are local to the web server. For example, files like `/etc/passwd` or `config.php` may be included by manipulating the file inclusion parameter.
  
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**: Occurs when an attacker can include files from remote servers, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.

---

### **Script Details**

- **Predefined Dorks**: The script includes a list of Google Dorks that are commonly used to detect both LFI and RFI vulnerabilities. These dorks target URL parameters like `?page=`, `?file=`, `?url=`, etc.
  
- **Input Validation**: When running the script, the user is prompted to input a domain, and the script generates Google search links for that domain by inserting it into the predefined dorks.

- **Output File**: The generated search links are saved to a text file named `lfi_rfi_dork_links_<domain>.txt`. This file can be opened for later reference or used for further testing.

---

### **Requirements**

- **Bash**: The script is designed to run in a Linux or Unix-based environment with Bash shell.
- **jq**: The script uses `jq` for URL encoding. Ensure that `jq` is installed on your system. You can install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install jq
  ```

---

### **Important Notes**

- **Ethical Use**: This script is intended for **ethical security testing** only. You should only run the script against websites and servers that you own or have explicit permission to test.
  
- **Google Search Limits**: Google may limit search queries if too many are performed in a short period. Use the script responsibly.

- **Vulnerability Testing**: These dorks are used to search for potential LFI and RFI vulnerabilities. However, finding a vulnerable search result does not automatically mean a vulnerability exists. You will need to perform further testing and validation.
